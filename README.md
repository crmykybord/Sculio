**What is Sculio?**

_Sculio_ is a Balatro mod that is currently in development. It aims to add a collection of jokers that feel faithful to the vanilla artstyle and synergise well with base jokers. Think of it as an unofficial DLC. 

**What does Sculio add to the game?**

Currently we have implemented 45 new jokers, however it is unclear whether we will add vouchers, new consumables, variants or decks to the game. Any other content will be considered later in development once all jokers have been ironed out for bugs and have been properly balanced. 

**Is Sculio compatible with other Balatro Mods?**

Currently we have no intention of supporting other Balatro mods. This is our last priority as _Sculio_ is meant to be played standalone with the base game.

**I found a bug in the mod. Where do I go to report it?**

Report it in the official Balatro discord server by posting a detailed description of the problem in _#modding, Sculio_.

</p>

**Ensure you have <ins>SteamModded</ins> and <ins>Lovely</ins> is installed. _These are essential and the mod will not work if these are not installed. Installation instructions are below:_**
https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki

**1. Download the zip file.**
 
You can download the zip file by pressing the dropdown menu labelled _'Code'_ and by pressing the _'Download Zip'_ button. 

**2. Open/extract the Sculio zip file.**
 
This will leave you with a folder named Sculio-main. 

**3. Transfer the Sculio-main folder (extracted) into the Mods folder.**
 
The mod folder is located in User/Appdata/Roaming/Balatro/Mods. Ensure that the folder is called Sculio-main.

**4. Launch the game.**

Go into steam and launch the game. Sculio should be in the mod menu and should be configurable from there. If you have any difficulties regarding the installation feel free to ask for help in ‚Å†our discord server.

_Keep in mind that Sculio may not be compatible with other mods, and this may interfere with how stable Balatro is. Easiest way to fix this issue is to delete/disable every other mod._
